# JTS-HW15-Plotly

This assignment is all about Plotly JavaScript library. Plotly allows the user to create powerful interactive charts and graphs. It is based on the D3.js and stack.gl software packages. Our dataset is based on the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which tracks microbes found in human navels. First, we are asked to create a horizontal graph of the top 10 OTUs found in individuals with a hovertext option of otu_labels for the chart. Next, we are asked to create a buble chart with the following features:

\* Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

\* Use `sample_values` for the y values.

\* Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

\* Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

\* Use `otu_labels` for the text values.

A demographic Info box is also found on the webpage with the id, ethnicity, gender, age, location, bbtype and wfreq that updates when the sample pulldown is updated.
